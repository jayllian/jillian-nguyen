        <p><h2 class="section-title">About the Project</h2>
<p>Davis Dance Revolution is a recap video of the annual dance competition hosted by the UC Davis Center for Student Involvement. This event, which closes Picnic Day every year, features several different UCD dance teams battling for first place.
</p>

<h2 class="section-title">The Works</h2>
    <p>Shooting for this project was tricky because we recognize that videography for choreographed dance is an art in it of itself. After researching several other dance videos, I told our videographers to keep two things in mind. One, the camera should be a co-performer with the rest of the dancers. This means that it should move with the action and match the fluidity of the ballerinas or aggression of the hip hop dancers.</p>
    <p>Two, the dancers&rsquo; bodies and limbs should frame the shots. All of the dances consisted of carefully planned formations. By shooting with simple wide shots from the center, we would be doing these beautiful stage pictures no justice. I asked the videographers to let the arms and legs of foreground dancers frame the image for the rest of the crew in the background. This added dimension and fun dynamism to our composition. </p>
    <p>To ensure that we didn&rsquo;t disrupt the performances day-of, we asked to film during a technical rehearsal where some of the crews would be dressed in their costumes. Below is the gameplan I wrote out to coordinate which videographers would be responsible for what.</p>
     <div class="pp-gallery">

                <img src="2019 DDR Gameplan-1.jpg" alt="First page of DDR gameplan" width=444px height=auto />
            </figure>
            <figure class="pp-gallery-item">
                <img src="2019 DDR Gameplan-2.jpg" alt="Second page of DDR gameplan" width=444px height=auto />
            </figure>
        </div>
    <p>When it came to the editing, my vision was to tell the story through the emotions. I wanted the viewer to feel the anticipation and nerves, the energy from the crowd, the adrenaline once those dancers hit the stage. Our editor played with the pacing of the video perfectly to capture this!<p>
    <p>If we were to film this event next year again, I definitely want to encourage our videographers to get closer to the dancers (with caution!). I also would like to prepare with better low-light equipment as the lighting of the event was gorgeous. Side note: This was also an event in which I was emceeing! While my Executive Producer was directing this project with me, I hope to spend more time with the crew next year now that I&rsquo;ve retired from the limelight.</p>
