        <p><h2 class="section-title">About the Project</h2>
<p>2019 Housing Day is a recap video that summarized all the highlights of the annual Housing Day, hosted by ASUCDâ€™s HAUS. Various apartments, legal services, and rental companies tabled at this event to promote their spaces or services to students.</p>
<br>
<h2 class="section-title">The Works</h2>
    <p>After having previously filmed at the 2018 Housing Day, I knew what to expect in terms of layouts, booths, and vibe. This was a short and sweet event recap video, one that would also be used to promote Housing Day 2020.</p>
    <p>Our videographers were well-briefed on their expectations and we even had a couple shadows jump in on the ride! Overall, this was a smooth project with great communication from our client, ASUCD HAUS, as well.</p>
