        <p><h2 class="section-title">About the Project</h2>
<p>Ninth Annual UC Davis Equity Summit, titled “Rituals of Resistance” this year, is a recap video featuring all the highlights of this annual summit. This was a client video commissioned by the UC Davis Office of Research and Policy for Equity.</p>
<br>
<h2 class="section-title">The Works</h2>
    <p>Boy, oh boy. This was one of the biggest projects I had ever directed in my life. The pre-production involved in this was massive because of how organized and by-the-clock the entire summit ran. The event coordinators created internal agendas for everyone involved in the summit, so naturally, it was only fair for me to create some for our videographers as well. The summit also happened during a school day, which meant lots of confusing shifts for our crew as people were popping in and out of their classes.</p>

    <p>Thank god for my amazing Executive Producer and crew for keeping me sane. Our client was well-equipped and prepared with all the details of this event. Who&rsquo;s performing when, where they&rsquo;ll be moving around the space, which door is best to exit when. And at the end of their flood of information, they always reminded us one thing – trust our gut. I love collaborating with a team that knew what they wanted and still gave us creative freedom!</p>
    <p>The clients we worked with for this event were some of my favorite this year. The event itself was inspirational and full of soul. I hope to return next year and do an even better job, now that we know what to expect from this 8-hour shift of rock and roll!</p>
