        <p><h2 class="section-title">About the Project</h2>
<p>The Calvin Handy Leadership Award is apart of a series commissioned by the UC Davis Office of the Chancellor. This video introduced the Calvin Handy Leadership award at the annual awards ceremony, Soaring to New Heights.</p>
<br>
<h2 class="section-title">The Works</h2>
    <p>Of the three videos requested in this series, this video was one of the simpler ones. We essentially had to describe the importance of safety in the Davis community, as well as the nomination criteria for a recipient of the Calvin Handy Award.</p>
    <p>When we heard we were successful in snagging an interview with the Chancellor (perks of his office being your client), we were thrilled! The timeslot was given to us on very short notice as we found out that evening that his interview would be the following  morning at 8am sharp. Did I skip my 8am discussion? Yes. Was it worth it? Totally.</p>
    <p>To ensure that we didn&rsquo;t disrupt the performances day-of, we asked to film during a technical rehearsal where some of the crews would be dressed in their costumes. Below is the gameplan I wrote out to coordinate which videographers would be responsible for what.</p>
    <p>The rest of this video went smoothly after we filmed some b-roll of a speech Calvin Handy was giving the week after. With the help of some fabulous editors and their great ear for non-copyrighted music, we made it to a clean and well-polished final draft!</p>
