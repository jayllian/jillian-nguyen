<h2 class="section-title">About the Project</h2>
<p>Pantry Benefit Video is a video showcased at a charity event for the Pantry of ASUCD. This video was marketed prior to the Pantry’s move in location, and explained the transitional period as well as the goal behind the move and rebrand.</p>

<h2 class="section-title">The Works</h2>
    <p>You know those projects that look straightforward and to the point, but really there was a lot of hell going on behind the scenes?</p>
    <p>This is one of them.</p>
    <p>This project ended up pushing into our winter break, after finals. I was getting my nails done in San Jose when I received a Slack message from our editor about how he was unable to finish the final draft because he was – wait for it... – on a plane flying to the Philippines. That was around 3pm? The draft was due at 5pm. And not a <i>soft</i> 5pm. Like, the event starts at 5 and we're gonna play your video at 5pm. Yikes.</p>
    <p>Now I absolutely hate working on projects I direct because I think it sets a bad double-dipping precedent. And for this one, I was already drawing illustrations to mock up what the new location would look like! But when I say I sped home after my nails were finished to speed edit that final draft, I am not kidding. I added my illustrations, threw in sound effects, exported that bad boy, and sent it to our clients in about 30 minutes or so.</p>
    <p>But of course, the public doesn't see me balancing my phone between my shoulder and chin to stress out with my Executive Producer while my acrylics are getting shaped. They only see a chippy clip about the next chapter for the Pantry.</p> 
    <p>And that's exactly the way we want it to be.</p>
    <p></p>
