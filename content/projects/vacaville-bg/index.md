<h2 class="section-title">About the Project</h2>
<p>Vacaville Boys & Girls Club is a video shown at the annual Vacaville Boys & Girls Club Chocolate Gala. This video shared several anecdotes of parents, children, and staff members of the Boys & Girls Club for prospective donors to hear.</p>

<h2 class="section-title">The Works</h2>
    <p>This project was my first one ever as Client Media Director of Aggie Studios. I was not only learning the ropes of my own position, but also tying and knotting new ones as I essentially co-crafted this brand new department with the studio's restructure. While this seems like your average b-roll and interviews layout, there was a lot of work that went in behind the scenes to get to this final product. Ten drafts, to be exact. Probably more.
    <p>I prepped beforehand with tons of research on the organization before jotting up some questions to ask. Even with a list of pre-made questions, I knew I wanted all the interviews to be colloquial, fluid, and human. That's why I saw the questions as a rough starting guide for these conversations to flourish, rather than a script I had to go through as an interviewer.</p>

                </figure>
        </div>
    <p>The interviews themselves were amazing, and my appreciation for the altruism and compassion of this organization has infinitely grown. I heard so many stories from struggling parents, to eager students, to the older mentors of the organization that have surpassed their adversities and continue to grow as intelligent young leaders. We wouldn't have been able to do these stories justice by haphazardly chopping them up and tossing music over the whole thing. So those ten drafts I was talking about?</p>

    <p>Yeah, those weren't an exaggeration. As tough as I am on our editors, my priority is always also to keep their morale high. I don't necessarily always sugarcoat, but I do give credit when it's due. Our team has amazing grit and tenacity. And for a first Client Media project, I think it definitely shines through.
