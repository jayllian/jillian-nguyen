My name is Jillian, like Jack-and-Jill plus Ian or million times J. As an award-winning editor and director, I’m passionate about creating pieces of <span style="color: #f5d690">visual content</span> that push the boundaries of storytelling and narratology. This is best manifested in my current work where I direct production crews of 5-15 people to create videos for clients ranging from student organizations to prestigious university departments. In a culture that is flooded with a constant stream of graphic information, I’m interested in producing content that <span style="color: #f5d690">engages, informs, and inspires.</span> I hope to forward my experience in video production, marketing, and advertising by collaborating with new clients to produce <span style="color: #f5d690">deliciously challenging projects</span> of high-caliber content.
