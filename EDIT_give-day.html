                <b>UC Davis 2019 Give Day</b> is an advertisement highlighting the different funds available for donors to contribute to during Give Day. At a glance, it featured all various units and awards that serve UC Davis students throughout each school year.

                 This video had a hard limit of 45 seconds max and needed to feature as many of the funds as possible within that timeframe. My main challenge was meeting this limit, while still <b>conveying the impact</b> that each unit and award makes on students at UC Davis.

                  I decided to do this by selecting shots of each organization in action, as opposed to just signs outside their offices. I chose tittilating music (royalty free track hunts are always a challenge!) that matched the feeling of <b><i>working on a mission</i></b>.

                And that's exactly what I wanted the viewer to leave thinking. By donating to one of these funds, you too could join the mission to help better the lives of UC Davis students in need.
