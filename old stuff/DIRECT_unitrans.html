                Unitrans 2019 Winter Referendum is an animated advertisement that educated student voters on the Unitrans Referendum in the 2019 ASUCD winter elections. This referendum passed with a 91% yes and broke voter turnout history in UC Davis.

                Our very first meeting with Unitrans' General Manager was both intimidating and exciting. We were given a <b>purpose</b> (encourage students to vote), <b>facts</b> (22,000 riders a day), and a <b>quick turnaround required</b> (2 months... gulp).

                This was the first large and very high-stakes project our studio had with our animation department. It was a large learning curve I had to overcome as a director in terms of learning how to communicate with animators, understanding how their creative process worked, and creating a story from a pile of facts and statistics.
